# Pairwise-Sequence-Alignment-of-RAD51C-and-RAD51D-Genes-A-Comparative-Genomic-Study
This project compares RAD51C and RAD51D mRNA sequences via pairwise alignment to explore their similarity in DNA repair. As key HR genes linked to cancer, understanding their relationship aids genomic research, diagnostics, and therapy. Results offer insight into functional overlap and mutation impacts.
